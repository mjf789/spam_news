### **Abstract**

News media, as an influential superstructure in modern society, often narrates on the disparities among social groups in their leadership pursuits. The present research employs an archival analysis to investigate how news media frames the discussion of these disparities at the intersection of gender identity and racial-ethnic identity, focusing on the unequal representation and treatment of particular social groups relative to one another. I collected 462 news articles from 20 news sources with the most user-traffic in the United States for content coding. Specifically, researchers coded these articles with respect to their narrative framing, gender identity focus, and racial-ethnic identity focus. Analyses suggest that articles narratives reference the underrepresentation of women more than the overrepresentation of men, as well as the underrepresentation of people of color more than the overrepresentation of White people. Applying an intersectional identity lens, I found that the articles referenced the underrepresentation of women of color more than the overrepresentation of White men. When describing the outcomes experienced by leaders, the articles focused more on the obstacles experienced by women (especially women of color) and people of color compared to their successes. I discuss the implications of these findings for the role that news media plays in conveying messages about leadership disparities within the United States.

### **News Media’s Framing of Leadership Disparities at the Intersection of Gender and Race**

Within United States society, leadership disparities exist—and persist—to widening degrees, disparities that disproportionately favor men on the level of gender identity within multiple sectors. This favoring often leads to men being rewarded with greater positions of hierarchical power and status. For example, men are twice as likely to be hired as corporate executives compared to women (Kim et al., 2021). For every 87 women promoted to managerial roles in top corporations, 100 men are promoted to those same roles, resulting in men significantly outnumbering women at the managerial and c-suite levels (Thomas et al., 2021).  
In academia, men are far more likely to be considered for and granted tenure-track positions and are significantly more likely to retain these high-ranking positions compared to women (Kelly, 2022; IPEDS Data Center, 2018). In government, men serve as approximately three- quarters of all political candidates in the United States government and hold more than 80% of

U.S. congressional seats (Motel, 2020\) despite comprising only about half of the United States adult population. Leadership disparities consistently favor men for positions of relational power and prestige.

### **Framing Theory**

However, while these disparities tend to favor men, and usually White men, the descriptive narrative about these disparities may not always be *framed* in this manner. Along with historically systemic conditions that continuously devalue and marginalize women, leadership disparities on the level of gender identity might also be the result of how individuals

in society typically describe leadership, or, more scientifically, the cognitive frame with which individuals discuss the issue at hand. Framing, here, refers to the way individuals form a specific conceptualization of or reorient their thinking about an issue, as influenced by an often-reputable source of information (e.g., news media) (Chong & Druckman, 2007). A theory that finds its theoretical origins in communication science and political science, the framing of any given event can suggest how individuals should process relevant information about that event in material reality (Goffman, 1974). The framing of an event, such as through news institutions, social media, etc., can have a profound influence on the perception of that event for individuals.

Take, for instance, comments made by the American Association of University Women (AAUW) about the reinforcement of outmoded stereotypes as a barrier to women’s leadership. The association states, “Traditionally, power structures \[in the United States\] value traits thought of as masculine and do not view them as favorably when they are exhibited by women” (AAUW, 2016). According to the established status quo in the United States, to be a leader means to be assertive, commanding, and strong—adjectives that are typically viewed as being associated with the gendered construct of masculinity, socioculturally speaking. In this way, a rhetorical frame such as the one presented above can allow an individual to organize their thinking about gendered stereotypes by providing meaning to both the historical and material facts about gender identity as is constructed in the United States (Tuchman, 1978; Gamson & Modigliani, 1987). This organization of thought is only made possible by the frame that an informant provides.

### **News Media and Framing**

In today’s cyberage, most individuals in society get their information about the world from the news, and the news tends to have a heavy influence on public perception about a myriad of social issues. Indeed, as a superstructure in United States society, the news can greatly affect the political atmosphere by manipulating the relative significance assigned to different sociopolitical issues (Oliver et al., 2019). Research synthesizing framing theory and the psychological effects of engaging with news media shows that the news can also influence how people construct cognitive frameworks surrounding morally infused social issues. It is noted that these subjective frameworks have potential predictive value in advancing individual—and sometimes collective—support for certain policy solutions (Entman, 1993; Edy & Meirick, 2007; Oliver et al., 2019). In today’s newsrooms, journalists and editors write stories about sociopolitical events that contain valuable information for individuals to interpret. This information can then affect individuals’ beliefs and worldviews about the issues described, along with *how* those issues should be addressed in society. In this way, a frame is what integrates various informational elements into a coherent parcel that can influence perception and social cognition of audiences meaningfully (Oliver et al., 2019).

### **Framing Influences Perception and Social Cognition**

On a more semantic basis, frames can change who individuals focus on and to whom individuals ascribe agency. Manipulation of linguistic properties in a given language can dramatically shape perception and cognition about a social issue. Specifically, shifting the way a

subject or issue is described—or shifting how it is framed—can produce noticeable changes in the way individuals respond to that subject or issue. One important kind of frame involves the use of active or passive voice in a constructed sentence, which is a shift in framing that affects causal agency.

For example, a subject, or noun, phrase in a sentence referenced with the use of active voice is made more salient (i.e., made the center of attention) and is subsequently assigned responsibility for a given outcome. In contrast, a subject referenced with the use of passive voice may be assigned *indirect* responsibility for a given outcome—even in cases where a subject may actually be a recipient or victim of a described event (Bohner, 2001; Henley et al., 1995). The degree of scrutiny here depends on what is semantically related and therefore accepted in the English language (syntactic and semantic understandings of the predominant language over the course of an individual’s lifetime, and across generations). Research shows that individuals tend to attribute causality of a perceived outcome to the cause that is made most salient, regardless of that attribution’s subjective accuracy (Duval & Wicklund, 1973; Kanouse, 1972; McArthur & Post, 1977; Pryor & Kriss, 1977; Storms, 1973; Taylor & Fiske, 1975; Taylor & Fiske, 1978). For instance, due to the psycholinguistic phenomenon of semantic ambiguity, a sentence like, “This woman was paid less,” can inadvertently invoke the inference that the “woman” in the sentence is the active participant in getting less pay. In other words, through employment of passive voice, the “woman” is made to be the agent responsible for being paid less (Penelope, 1990).

Frames can also shift emotional responding about a social issue (e.g., Kinder & Sanders, 1990; Mendelberg, 2001; Nelson et al., 1997; Chong & Druckman, 2007; Gross & D’ambrosio, 2004). For example, inequality can be framed as either being perpetuated by a majority group *or* experienced by a minority group, which affects group-based guilt among members of the advantaged group being referenced (Iyer et al., 2003; Powell et al., 2005). In like manner, framing inequity as majority group advantage strengthens support for policies to reduce unfairly accruing privilege for the group in question (Lowery et al., 2012). What’s more, a change in framing of a sociopolitical issue, by highlighting marginalized group disadvantage relative to privileged group advantage, can bolster support for redistributive policies to ameliorate societal inequality (Chow & Galak, 2012; Dietze & Craig, 2020). Such evidence suggests that framing material disparity as either majority group advantage or minority group disadvantage shifts affective and attitudinal responses to the inequality taking place.

Research pertaining to rhetoric habituation and group membership also suggests that individuals are inclined to plan their future actions based on how they expect to *feel* about certain future situations and/or outcomes as related to their group identity (Baumeister et al., 2007; Mellers and McGraw, 2001). One study that was conducted investigating adolescent youths’ affective responses to their future academic trajectories found that high school girls— but not high school boys—expected for themselves to experience more negative and less positive subjective emotions during their undergraduate studies in a university department dominated by boys and men scholars. In addition, in an experimental scenario designed to activate negative gender stereotypes, researchers found that women who expected to feel

unpleasant emotions in their future career paths felt less inclined to pursue careers in STEAM fields, compared to women in a non-stereotype activating scenario (Schuster & Martiny, 2017). As implied by these findings, women (and girls) who expect to feel less comfortable in contexts where they will be disadvantaged—and *know* they will be disadvantaged (in relation to advantaged men)—may be more likely to avoid career fields that bolster negative gender stereotypes, just as a function of anticipatory negative emotions. The ironic, and thus unfortunate, consequence of this phenomenon could be that affected individuals will altogether disengage from discussions surrounding these disparities. Such disengagement could make the problem of leadership disparities seem unsolvable to the disadvantaged group—the group that is being made salient in the first place.

### **Leadership Representation Framed on the Dimension of Gender Identity**

Social psychological findings about leadership representation between women and men often highlight the detrimental effects of framing this discussion as women’s underrepresentation. Indeed, when leadership disparity is framed as women’s underrepresentation, individuals tend to ascribe the cause of this gender gap more to women than to men, relative to when the same disparity is described as men’s overrepresentation (Bruckmüller & Braun, 2020; Murray, 2014). Critical research suggests that narrative frames focusing on women as being underrepresented in male-dominated fields can indirectly emphasize gender identity, within social contexts, as a distinguishable identity, thereby concentrating on women as the causal group for their representational disparities in leadership (Convertino, 2019). In a certain sense, underrepresentation frames can operate as a process

whereby gender differences (mainly between women and men) maintain the construction of women’s underrepresentation in established career fields. In this sense, women, as a gender- class group in society, are thus made to be both in the periphery (relative to men) and held in the spotlight in fields dominated by men (Crenshaw, 1991; Convertino, 2019). Such frames shift whether women or men are made salient in the eyes of perceivers who care about this social issue—and which are the active agents or subjects in a constructed sentence.

### **Leadership Achievement Framed on the Dimension of Gender Identity**

Similarly, individuals talking about this social issue can either focus on the systemic obstacles in place for a certain social group, or that same group’s accomplishments in pursuing and retaining leadership roles. For the purposes of our research, specifically, I will be referring to the contradiction of obstacles and successes as a group’s “scope of achievement”. Other social psychological research on the matter suggests that the emphasis placed on women’s obstacles in a career field dominated by men may lead women to feel less qualified and more isolated from their scholarly peers in that field. However, when presented with the successes of gender matched role-models—rather than obstacles faced—women may be less likely to experience feelings of incompetence in career fields dominated by men and become more confident in their leadership pursuits (Lockwood, 2006).

Research also suggests that highlighting the successes of gender-matched role models for young girls in fields considered to be stereotypically masculine (e.g., physics, athletics) helps in allowing those girls to foresee a successful future for themselves within those fields

(Midgley et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2020). In turn, obstacle framing only works to strengthen negative gender stereotypes for young girls and women, in comparison to young boys and men who face far less hardships in their leadership pursuits. In addition to changes in the semantic and rhetorical style of narrative framing, the *content* of an informant’s postulates can be manipulated, as well. How audiences engage with an actual narrative of leadership disparities has just as much influence on their response to the matter as linguistic framing.

### **Framing Disparities at the Nexus of Gender and Race**

While gender disparities in leadership is quite well documented within the social psychological literature, often investigating women’s disproportionate underrepresentation in various sectors (e.g., Mackelprang et al., 2023; Diekman et al., 2021; Simon et al., 2022; Diekman et al., 2021; Casad et al., 2022), this same discussion often lacks an intersectional character—the nuance of considering framing prevalence among source informants as a function of not only gender identity, but also racial-ethnic identity. For clarity, intersectionality is a scientific framework for analyzing the distinct merging of sociopolitical identities for a group—and the ways in which these mergers conjure novel instances of disparity, discrimination, and relational privilege in society (Crenshaw, 1989). For example, Crenshaw makes note that women of color (especially Black women) are quite often excluded from certain discussions about society, on a material level—mainly because these discussions are based on a set of experiences that often do not accurately reflect the interaction of gender identity and racial-ethnic identity on sociopolitical grounds. Rather than being a set of stereotypes that converge superficially, social identities like “Black” and “women” combine to create a new social

group altogether. It is readily evident that the core of intersectionality stresses the importance of analyzing socially pertinent arguments on a holistic level, acknowledging the many identities that individuals perceive in others and claim for themselves (e.g., racial-ethnic identity, social class, nationality, etc.).

Scant research examines the impact of frames on psychological reactions, taking an intersectional identity lens. For instance, one study conducted by Jun and colleagues investigated the way in which social inequality is described in news media publications, focusing on race, gender, and wealth inequality. The researchers found that racial-ethnic identity and gender identity are commonly described as being subordinate group disadvantage than dominant group advantage and point to news media’s chronic negligence of the advantages experienced by White individuals and men (Jun et al., 2022). However, the study’s focus on social inequality does not highlight the advantages that White men experience as a distinct social group—on a strictly intersectional level. As noted by Crenshaw, racial-ethnic identity, and sex (or gender identity) become a poignant intersectional coupling specifically when this merger disadvantages marginalized groups in society. Here, the social constructs of privileged whiteness and masculinity within the United States are hegemonic standards, implicit in their functions and thus less likely to be perceived (and scrutinized) relative to groups who do not embody these core characteristics (Crenshaw, 1989).

### **The Present Research**

The goal of this archival analysis was to investigate the ways in which news media frame gender disparity discussion. Second, the analysis considers how often news media consider the racial-ethnic identity of the two gender groups (i.e., women and men) most often focused on in the context of leadership domains. Specifically, I conducted an archival content analysis of narrative frames within popular online news media (e.g., CNN, NPR, etc.), documenting the prevalence of overrepresentation, underrepresentation, obstacles, and successes framing when discussing leadership disparities among gender and racial-ethnic identities. That is, I took an intersectional approach to documenting prevalence rates in narrative framing by considering the differences in framing prevalence in the news as a function of both gender identity *and* racial-ethnic identity.

To meet these goals, I created a comprehensive archive of news articles from news websites with the most user traffic. I then tallied explicit instances of framing for gender and racial-ethnic groups within these news articles to explore two main hypotheses: First, I hypothesized that underrepresentation and obstacles faced for women of color will be reported on more in the news compared to White women and all men; second, overrepresentation and successes experienced for White men will be reported on more in the news compared to men of color and all women.

### **Methodology**

**News Source Selection**

I collected news articles discussing leadership disparities at the nexus of gender identity and racial-ethnic identity from online news sources with the most user traffic. I gauged identification of news sources with the most user traffic by calculating the number of unique monthly visitors, both nationwide and globally, according to and organized by news ranking websites (i.e., oTechWorld, PureVPN, and Visual Capitalist). Sources not included in this analysis are MSN, Google News, People, The Sun, Business Insider, Buzzfeed, and CBS. MSN, Google News, and CBS often published articles that seemed to be duplicates of articles published through other sources. People, The Sun, and Buzzfeed were excluded due to their reporting on matters related to celebrities and gossip, topics less relevant to the analysis at hand. Business Insider was not included due to its relatively lower user traffic count compared to more popular sources. Otherwise, all sources included were considered the *most* trafficked, as of 2022\.

Drawing from AllSides’ Media Bias Ratings—which conduct editorial reviews, blind bias surveys, community feedback initiatives, and other methods to ensure bias rating accuracy—I selected news sources that varied with respect to the political leaning of the journalist institutions in question (AllSides, 2023). Bias identification is based on the United States’ interpretation of the binary spectrum of the electoral landscape (i.e., Left/Right, Democratic/Republican, Liberal/Conservative). It should be noted that most of the included news sources were identified as being Left/Left-Leaning and Center-Moderate with respect to their political leaning (see Table 1).

### **News Article Selection**

I conducted an archival search for news articles using Factiva and ProQuest databases, through New York University’s Division of Libraries. These databases act as simple search engines; inputting a phrase will yield articles most relevant to that phrase. One set of searches focused primarily on non-intersectional gender identity or racial-ethnic identity (e.g., women in leadership). Another set of searches focused on the intersection of gender identity and racial-ethnic identity (e.g., women of color in leadership). A third set of searches focused on the intersection of gender identity and racial-ethnic identity, with each racial-ethnic identity searched for separately, according to how the U.S. census labels each racial-ethnic group (e.g., Indigenous women, Asian men, Black/African American women, etc.). Within the search databases, it was possible to search for articles that talked about a demographic group, in by modifying the correlative conjunctions between words. For instance, to search for articles that spoke about women of color, I input “Women” AND “of color” WITH “leadership,” in the search bar. To search for articles that spoke only about the overrepresentation of, say, White women, I input “White women” AND “underrepresentation” WITH “leadership”. The “AND” here acts as a Boolean term, such that the search engine within the database will only pick up on articles that contain the demographic group and the frame as phrases/terms in the context of leadership. Similarly, just using “leadership” as a term still yielded articles that talked about academia, government, and corporate business, as these sectors are often referenced when an article includes the term “leadership”.

The use of search phrases in this way yielded many relevant news articles, which were filtered according to media type (i.e., news), date range, and source of interest. Relevant articles were then saved as .pdf files. The full list of terms and phrases can be found in the Supplement. I identified relevant news within a timeframe that spanned from January 2018 to April 2022\. The advent of the MeToo movement presented a sharp increase in

news media’s depiction of the intersectional topic of disparities in leadership in early 2018, specifically in light of the legal allegations of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein in October 2017\. This galvanized public discussion of workplace disparity—including the leadership pursuits of more marginalized groups (for a review, see Nikolova, 2021).

### **News Article Cleaning**

Overall, I collected 537 relevant news articles across the identified news sources. After data cleaning, I identified 496 relevant articles. I removed 11 articles from the analyses because they did not specifically satisfy the leadership domain criterion. I defined leadership as the ability for an individual (or a group of individuals) to enlist the aid of like-minded individuals to accomplish a common task—within spheres of corporate business, academia/education, and legislative government. I removed 30 other news articles because they did not describe demographic disparities at all. For instance, an article may talk about leadership disparity, but make no mention of representation or scope of achievement for gender or racial-ethnic groups. I disregarded any news article that did not satisfy the above criteria.

Of all articles collected, 24 came from sources identified as having a Right/Right- leaning bias, 204 came from sources having a Center bias, and 272 came from sources identified as a having a Left/Left-leaning bias. Since Right/Right-leaning biased media does not cover leadership disparities at the intersection of gender and race at consistently high degrees, there occurred an imbalance in our collected dataset’s cell sizes. As such, it was not possible to

meaningfully explore interaction effects with the political bias of identified sources in the overall analysis.

### **Article Coding and Design**

I, along with 9 laboratory research assistants, coded the explicit narrative content of all news articles. To ensure rater reliability and high rater convergence, 2 raters coded each news article. We coded prevalence rates for mentions of target gender identity, target racial-ethnic identity, and target frames including underrepresentation, overrepresentation, obstacles faced, and successes experienced (see Table 2).

| Frames & Definitions | Example anecdote |
| ----- | ----- |
| Underrepresentation |  |
|    Must explicitly state a group's appearance in leadership at rates **lower** than expected; can include percentages and/or numbers, but is not a requirement. | "At America's largest and most powerful companies... only 1 in every 443 Black or Hispanic workers holds a top job" (Green, 2021). |
| Overrepresentation |  |
|    Must explicitly state a group's appearance in leadership at rates **higher** than expected; can include percentages and/or numbers, but is not a requirement. | "In the United States, men account for 81 percent of board chairs and make up about 95 percent of CEOs" (Attias, 2018). |
| Obstacles |  |
|    Describes a systemic hindrance or barrier in pursuing leadership (e.g., sexism, racism, lack of support). | "White women face a 'glass ceiling,' but women of color face a 'concrete ceiling'" (Carpenter, 2018). |
| Successes |  |
|    Describes an objective advancement, achievement, and/or accomplishment in pursuing leadership (e.g., record-breaking moments, historical landmarks). | "Breakthrough\! How three in every 10 directors of FTSE 100 firms are now women – hitting the target to smash the glass ceiling" (Nimmo, 2018).  |

Research assistants tallied the number of exemplars, or instances of each of the four narrative frames, and noted which, if any, demographic description of the target accompanied that frame. For instance, news reporters can describe women’s underrepresentation or women of color’s underrepresentation in leadership. Likewise, news reporters can describe the obstacles and/or successes in leadership that men or White men experience. Research assistants indicated the number of times that news articles described each frame and the demographic features of the target of that frame.

### **Rater Training**

We collectively generated a coding parameter guide to ensure rater objectivity.

Guidelines stated assistants should code for content *explicitly* written in the news articles, rather than what was implied by the journalist. In addition, assistants tallied exemplars as they read through the news articles, paragraph by paragraph, rather than reporting a gestalt

interpretation after reading the entire document. Reading paragraph by paragraph helped to avoid memory biases.

All assistants engaged in multiple training sessions. During training, assistants practiced coding the collected news articles individually then discussed their personal ratings with the rest of the team. We identified coding discrepancies and resolved them through collaborative discussion to sharpen the definitions in the coding parameter guidelines. After training, assistants coded all news articles independently. Two assistants coded each article, and pairs of assistants were shuffled to ensure that any individual differences in coding approaches were randomly allocated across articles. I averaged tally ratings from the two assistants on each dimension for each news article. As such, each article received scores reflecting the number of times it referenced under and overrepresentation of men, women, people of color, White people, White men, White women, men of color, and women of color. For clarity, “people of color” here is described collectively as non-White racial-ethnic groups (i.e., Black, Asian, Indigenous, Pacific Islander, and Latinx). Each article also received scores reflecting the number of times it referenced the obstacles and successes of each of these groups.

### **Inter-class Correlations**

I computed inter-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) as subgroup analyses to assess the absolute mean-rating agreement between news article coders in their ratings of predictor variable prevalence within the collected dataset. Since different pairs of coders rated different batches of articles for each round of coding, inter-class correlation coefficients were computed

for each unique pair, separately. All ICC estimates and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the ‘psych’ package in RStudio (Version 4.2.2). All correlation coefficient estimates were statistically significant at the .001 level, with an average *k* value of .75 (range 0.46-1.0). For a comprehensive statistical breakdown of each pair’s absolute agreement, please see the Supplement.

### **Results**

**Analytic Strategy**

I conducted General Linear Model Repeated Measures ANOVAs to identify any significant differences among the averaged tallies for each predictor variable, along with each dimension of interest. Specifically, I conducted 2X2 Repeated Measures ANOVAs on the frequency of mentions when news articles discussed narrative frames (e.g., underrepresentation, obstacles faced) and either gender identity or racial ethnic identity. I also conducted 2X2X2 Repeated Measures ANOVAs on the frequency of mentions when news articles discussed narrative frames, gender identity, *and* racial-ethnic identity. I ran follow up Repeated Measures Simple Effects Contrasts to test how one dimension was statistically different from another. Since the tests were determined a priori, the alpha level was kept at .05 for all tests, with mean-squared errors included in the statistical outputs for each contrast.

### **Under and Overrepresentation Frames**

*Frame and Gender Identity.* First, I conducted a 2 (target frame: underrepresentation, overrepresentation) X 2 (target gender identity: women, men) Repeated Measures ANOVA on the

frequency of mentions when news articles did not specify target racial-ethnic identity. There was a significant 2-way interaction between target frame and target gender identity, 

*F*(1, 495)=279.61, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.36. Women’s underrepresentation was referenced more frequently in the news relative to men’s overrepresentation, *F*(1, 495)=186.55, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.3 (see Table 3).

**Table 3**

## *Frequency Statistics of Representation and Gender Identity*

| Representation | Men | Women |
| :---- | ----- | ----- |
| Underrepresentation | 0.06  (.03)a | 2.47  (.15)b |
| Overrepresentation | 0.75  (.07)c | 0.25  (.05)d |

*Note*. Frequency (Means and SE in parentheses) of reporting under and overrepresentation frames as a function of gender identity. Cells that present different subscripts in a row or column differ at *p* \< .001. See Supplement for all statistical reporting.

*Frame and Racial-Ethnic Identity.* Second, I conducted a 2 (target frame: underrepresentation, overrepresentation) X 2 (target racial-ethnic identity: people of color, White people) Repeated Measures ANOVA on the frequency of mentions when news articles did not specify target gender identity. The interaction between target frame and target racial-ethnic identity was significant, *F*(1, 495)=57.2, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.10. The underrepresentation of people

of color was referenced more frequently in the news relative to the overrepresentation of White 

people, *F*(1, 495)=57.00, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.10. (see Table 4).

**Table 4**

## *Frequency Statistics of Representation and Racial-Ethnic Identity*

| Representation | White people | People of Color |
| :---- | ----- | ----- |
| Underrepresentation | .01  (.003)a | 0.94  (.12)b |
| Overrepresentation | 0.36  (.07)c | 0.11  (.03)d |

*Note.* Frequency (Means and SE in parentheses) of reporting under and overrepresentation frames as a function of racial-ethnic identity. Cells that present different subscripts in a row or column differ at *p* \< .001. See Supplement for all statistical reporting.

*Frame, Gender Identity, and Racial-Ethnic Identity*. When news articles took an intersectional approach to describing target demographics, I ran a 2 (target frame: underrepresentation, overrepresentation) X 2 (target gender identity: women, men) X 2 (target racial-ethnic identity: people of color, White) Repeated Measures ANOVA on the frequency of mentions when news articles specified target gender identity and target racial-ethnic identity. There was a significant 3-way interaction among target frame, target gender identity, and target racial-ethnic identity, *F*(1, 495)=24.3, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.05.

Though White men are overrepresented in leadership, the underrepresentation of women of color was referenced more frequently relative to the overrepresentation of White

men, *F*(1, 495)=24.50, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.05. The overrepresentation of White men was referenced more frequently in the news relative to the underrepresentation of White women, *F*(1, 495)=31.10, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.06, and to the underrepresentation of men of color, *F*(1, 495)=24.10, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.05.

In addition, though women are underrepresented in leadership, women of color’s underrepresentation was mentioned more frequently in the news relative to White women’s underrepresentation, *F*(1, 495)=57.34, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.10. Though people of color are underrepresented in leadership, women of color’s underrepresentation was mentioned more frequently relative to men of color’s underrepresentation, *F*(1, 495)=57.20, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.10 (see Table 5).

### **Obstacles and Successes Frames**

*Frame and Gender Identity.* I conducted a 2 (target frame: obstacles, successes) X 2 (target gender identity: women, men) Repeated Measures ANOVA on the frequency of mentions when news articles did not specify racial-ethnic identity. There was a significant 2-way interaction between target frame and target gender identity, *F*(1, 495)=86.133, *p*\<.001, *η2p* \=0.15. Examining tendencies, women’s obstacles appeared more frequently in the news compared to men’s obstacles, *F*(1, 495)=200.00, *p*\<.001, *η2p* \=0.30. Though, in addition, women’s successes appeared more often relative to men’s successes, *F*(1, 495)=177.00, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.30. The news reported more on women’s obstacles faced than their successes, *F*(1, 495)=80.60, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.14. In contrast, the news reported more on men’s successes than their obstacles, *F*(1, 495)=13.68, *p*\<.01, *η2p*\=0.03. (see Table 6).

*Frame and Racial-Ethnic Identity.* Among content that did not specify the target’s gender identity, I conducted a 2 (target frame: obstacles, successes) X 2 (target racial-ethnic identity: people of color, White people) Repeated Measures ANOVA. There was a significant 2- way interaction between target frame and target racial-ethnic identity, *F*(1, 495)=28.00, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.05. The obstacles faced by people of color in leadership appeared more frequently in the news compared to White people’s obstacles, *F*(1, 495)=43.70, *p*\<.001,

*η2p*\=0.10. However, the successes of people of color still appeared more frequently in the news compared to White people’s successes, *F*(1, 495)=27.00, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.06. While White people’s successes and obstacles were reported in equal degree, *F*(1, 495)=0.003, *p*\=.954, *η2p*\=0.00, the obstacles that people of color face were reported on more often in the news relative to their successes, *F*(1, 495)=31.00, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.06 (see Table 7).

*Frame, Gender Identity, and Racial-Ethnic Identity*. When articles took an intersectional approach to describing target demographics, I ran a 2 (target frame: obstacles, successes) X 2 (target gender identity: women, men) X 2 (target racial-ethnic identity: people of color, White people) Repeated Measures ANOVA. There was a significant 3-way interaction between target frame, target gender identity, and target racial-ethnic identity, *F*(1, 495)=12.80, *p*\<.001,  
*η2p*\=0.03. We unpacked this by looking first at how frequently the two frames appeared for

each demographic group.

White men’s successes experienced in leadership were talked about at an equal degree in the news relative to their obstacles faced, *F*(1, 495)=0.02, *p*\=.903, *η2p*\=0.00. White women’s successes were referenced more frequently than their obstacles, *F*(1, 495)=9.00, *p*\=.003, *η2p*\=0.02. Men of color’s successes were referenced at an equal degree relative to their obstacles, *F*(1, 495)=0.80, *p*\=.371, *η2p*\=0.002. Lastly, women of color’s obstacles were highlighted more than their own successes, *F*(1, 495)=8.10, *p*\=.005, *η2p*\=0.02.

Next, we probed who was described in terms of their obstacles faced in leadership, specifically. Women of color’s obstacles were referenced more than men of color’s obstacles, *F*(1, 495)=55.12, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.10. Women of color’s obstacles were also referenced more than White women’s obstacles, *F*(1, 495)=58.00, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.11. Lastly, women of color’s

obstacles were highlighted more than White men’s obstacles, *F*(1, 495)=51.00, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.10.

	Finally, we probed who was described in terms of their successes experienced in leadership. The news reported more often on White women’s successes than White men’s successes, *F*(1, 495)=4.00, 

*p*\=.049, *η2p*\=0.01. Similarly, the news reported more often on women of color’s successes than men of color’s successes, *F*(1,495)=48.03, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.10. The news also reported on the successes of women of color more often than White women’s successes, *F*(1, 495)=25.0, *p*\<.001, *η2p*\=0.05. Lastly, men of color’s successes were referenced at an equal degree relative to White men’s successes, *F*(1, 495)=0.05, *p*\=.826, *η2p*\=0.00. (see Table 8).

### **General Discussion**

This archival analysis aimed to quantify the relative rates of news media’s framing of demographic disparities in leadership. When describing the proportions of demographics in leadership, I found that the news writes far more about the underrepresentation of women and people of color than the overrepresentation of men and White people. The news also reports the underrepresentation that women of color face more often than the overrepresentation that White men experience. When describing the achievements of leaders, I found that the news writes much more about the obstacles that women and people of color face than their successes. A key finding of the present research—contrary to part of my hypothesis—shows that the news reports more on the *successes* that women of color experience in their leadership pursuits relative to men of color and White women—and not the successes of White men. That is, the news writes more about the successes of women of color than the successes of White men. Still, while the news does write a great deal on the successes of women of color, the news writes even more on the obstacles women of color face.

Finally, the news writes very little on men of color’s successes or their obstacles; men of color are not referenced much at all in the news, relative to the other groups of interest in this analysis. Such a finding is interesting, since it implies that men of color do not get talked about

as much as other groups because they may not have the same “narrative schema” that the other groups have in the news. Whereas women of color are often framed as encountering the most disadvantages, White men encountering the most advantages, and White women falling somewhere in between these two groups, men of color are not framed in any particular way relative to the other groups. Although men of color do marginally surpass women of color in terms of representation and advantages (see Thomas et al., 2022), they do not seem to be reported on as much in public news media.

It is interesting to find that the news reports on both the obstacles faced *and* successes experienced by women of color at high prevalence rates. Theoretically, probably the most compelling explanation for this finding could be due to how gender stereotypes are established in society (Crenshaw, 1990). The normative group for “success,” at least historically, is White men. Success, here, can be interpreted as an objective term—things that are achieved, which yield favorable outcomes, in the context of leadership. When women of color succeed, this gender-class group becomes the non-normative group of success frames.

In other words, because women of color’s successes are unexpected—and thus non- normative—journalists in the newsrooms may be more likely to exemplify these success stories in their reporting. The successes of women of color are made more salient as a function of harmful stereotypes that dictate a certain narrative, one where individuals should not expect women of color to succeed in the United States. However, when they do succeed, it is reported on more than the successes of White women, or White men. Such salience is indicative of women’s status as a disenfranchised gender-class group relative to men in United States

society—both in the margins *and* in the spotlight in fields dominated by men. Hegemonic whiteness and masculinity within the United States work to ensure that women of color are simultaneously sidelined and surveilled when in pursuit of their leadership ambitions (Crenshaw, 1990). Put simply, when women of color do not succeed in their leadership pursuits, it is expected, and therefore it is not novel news. But when women of color do succeed, it is unexpected, and therefore it is novel news—news that is worthy of reporting on.

### **Limitations and Future Directions**

Although the present research clearly supports the general notion that women of color, relative to other groups in this analysis, are referenced most negatively in the news, it is duly appropriate to recognize several potential limitations herein. In like manner, it is necessary to mention potential future directions that researchers and scholars alike can take with our findings.

# ***Television, Social Network Platforms, and Other Forms of Media***

Future research would do well to study other forms of media besides internet news publications with respect to the leadership disparity discussion. While news media may be a superstructure of great influence in United States society, it is likely that the representation and achievements of certain demographic groups are narrated on in different ways through other means. For example, research shows that the collective use of Twitter hashtags among feminist social movements can have a profound effect on how those movements evolve and how women within those movements are viewed on the Twitter platform (Storer & Rodriguez, 2020).

Additionally, research investigating individuals’ use of social media highlights the harmful effects of group alliance surrounding hot-button discussions (e.g., abortion), and how these alliances can exacerbate stereotypical narratives about marginalized social groups (Cinelli et al., 2021).

# ***Racial-Ethnic Identity as a Future Moderator***

Another marked limitation of the present analysis is the determination of racial-ethnic identity as a moderator for the effects of gender identity in the leadership disparity discussion. For the sake of simplicity, we categorized racial-ethnic minority and majority groups in an overgeneralized fashion (i.e., people of color and White people). It is exceedingly common for news media to simplify the nuance of social identity in this way, and while virtually inseparable from modern social psychological discourse, the historically damaging social construct of race involves the inherent exclusion of individuals that identify themselves in more personable ways (e.g., Perez & Hirschman, 2009). This simplification of racial-ethnic identity only obfuscates the reality of racial-ethnic diversity within in the United States. Future research could expound on this variable to address the application of intersectionality more intuitively, an application that champions the complex compass of identity within the nation and across the many regions of the world. For instance, instead of categorizing individuals as simply “people of color,” researchers could note the obvious distinction between Black individuals, Caribbean individuals, East Asian individuals, Southeast individuals, and so on.

Even further, researchers could also consider the rich diversity *within* racial groups (e.g., instead of just “Black people,” distinctions could be made between Haitians, Jamaicans, Africans, etc.). As a future research question, are East Asians and White individuals more likely to be reported on as being overrepresented relative to Black and Latinx individuals? Are Latinas likely to experience more successes in leadership relative to Black women? And what of women from Indigenous populations? Questions such as the ones presented here can only strengthen the investigation of intersectional identities by dissecting monolithic labels and shedding light on disparities within economically exploited racial-ethnic groups (e.g., Esie & Bates, 2023; Busey & Silva, 2020). Research, for instance, shows that Black women—compared to White women, Latinas, and Asian women—have an overall worse experience in their corporate workplaces, receiving less managerial support and encouragement to pursue higher positions (Thomas et el., 2022). Though, very little research is conducted on the representation of women from Indigenous populations, if at all. These findings could reflect how women of different racial-ethnic identities are portrayed in popular news media.

# ***Gender Identity within the Context of Leadership Disparities***

Stemming directly from the racial-ethnic identity moderator limitation, future research would do well to examine representation and scope of achievement effects for more gender groups besides just women and men. For instance, how are Black transgender women referenced in the news? Do gender non-conforming individuals receive the same degree of attention as gender-conforming individuals? And what are the implications of these questions? For instance, research shows that transgender individuals are often not at all represented in the

news compared to cisgender individuals. However, when transgender individuals are talked about in the news, they are usually reported on in harmful ways (Billard, 2018). With this, it is very possible that transgender and nonbinary individuals experience far greater hardships in leadership relative to cisgender individuals. When taken in tandem with racial-ethnic identity, there are greater opportunities for deeper intersectional questions to explore.

# ***Timeframe of Article Collection***

The present research also only focused on a small timeframe of article collection—from January 2018 to April 2022\. Even though we chose this timeframe for a clear reason, future researchers could collect articles from before 2018 to gain a more holistic comprehension of narrative frame trends across generations, perhaps longitudinally. It is possible that journalists in the far past were using the same language that journalists use today when describing underrepresented women of color, both in the headlines and in the body text of written articles (e.g., Bimber, 2000; Boutyline et al., 2023; Biscomb et al., 2017).

# ***Efficacy-Focused Language***

As for direct follow-ups to this analysis, the collected archive could continue to address stark gaps in the social psychological literature with specific regard to the kinds of attitudinal responses that we as researchers can theoretically expect from affected audiences who read about this social issue. Research on collective action makes note of the possibility that priming passionate emotions—notably anger—can motivate mass groups of individuals to act on issues in society that are most relevant to their lives and the lives of their peers (van Zomeren et al.,

2004). Yet would it also be possible to encourage this same kind of intense motivation with feelings that are still passionate, but less volatile? The results from this study point to the theoretical possibility that if news sources used more efficacy-focused language (as opposed to deficit-focused language) when discussing disadvantaged groups (e.g., valuable characteristics, strengths, achievements, etc.), perhaps the news could aid in the priming of empowerment for these groups—a feeling that could promote effective engagement with this social issue on collective grounds.

# ***Journalists in the Newsrooms***

It is also worth noting the demographic makeup of journalists and editors in the newsrooms themselves—the individuals authoring these stories and the manifestation of potentially harmful biases they may harbor in the writing process. In like manner, the sociopolitical alignment of specific news sources could also play a key role. News sources become their own brands in that they are expected to report on certain social issues in certain ways (e.g., Shor, 2018). Based on their political leanings, it would be out of character for Daily Mail Online or Fox News (two right-leaning news sources) to suddenly advocate for the material working rights of Latinas, for instance—only because these news sources are not known to report on such an issue in this way. Further, it would be seen by dedicated audience members as out-of-pocket for CNN or The Guardian (two relatively left-leaning news sources) to narratively lambast Black women for their failures in achieving leadership success; this kind of narrative would be rare for these sources, and maybe even off-putting considering the “news reporting identity” that these institutions have established for themselves over the years.

What if news media, regardless of sociopolitical alignment or capitalist agenda, consistently highlighted the ways in which systemic conditions place White men in positions of hierarchical power and prestige, rather than focusing so heavily on all the ways in which women (especially women of color) struggle in their leadership pursuits? The nature of this question introduces both the practical implications of actively deconstructing the established status quo to a progressive, equitable end. It is entirely possible that this discussion would be in a vastly different place—a productive place—if journalists and readers were made aware of the consequences of narrative frame shifts. The news, as a superstructure within United States capitalist society, is exceptionally influential in today’s high-speed cyberage, and how a reader *approaches* topics of inequity is just as important as how a news outlet *presents* a particular story.

# ***Engagement with the News Industry***

Lastly, future analyses could also address audiences’ trust and investment in news media’s narration of social issues. Consider: Is an individual more likely to actively engage with a social issue if information about that issue is being disseminated from a news source they are deeply invested in? For instance, Pew Research shows that those who identify as Republican place more trust in Fox News significantly more than any other news source in the United States. The same research shows that those who identify as Democrat place significantly less trust in Fox News as a reputable news source (Gramlich, 2020). Similar research finds that ideologically left individuals prefer news reports from sources like CNN and NPR, whilst ideologically right individuals prefer news from sources like Fox News (Iyengar and Hahn,

2009). These findings point to the possibility that an individual who actively seeks out information from a particular news source—mainly based on political affinity—may be more likely to disregard information from news sources that diverge from their sociopolitical interests. This bias in news engagement could lead to an overall bias in support for certain policy changes (e.g., less, or more, support for women in leadership roles), along with the deepening of sociopolitical schisms between groups of differing worldviews (e.g., status quo conformists versus status quo disruptors).

### **Conclusion**

This archival analysis investigated how popular online news sources tailored their linguistic framing when reporting on leadership disparities at the nexus of gender identity and racial-ethnic identity, on a quantifiable level. The analysis brings to light a relative pattern within our collected dataset of how these disparities are commonly framed among some of the most sought-after news sources of societal information, sources that directly influence the way readers engage with this social issue. News media often frames women of color as having a challenging time attaining and retaining leadership positions relative to White women and all men. What is more, news media also often frames White men as being overrepresented in leadership relative to men of color and all women. Interestingly, however, the news is more inclined to report on the successes that women of color experience in leadership relative to men of color and White women—but not the successes of White men. Researchers in social psychology can expound on this project’s findings to incite healthier proactivity among

newsroom journalists, editors, and readers for respective parties to approach this discussion in a more productive manner.
