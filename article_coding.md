**ARTICLE CODING PARAMETERS**

**Coding Guidelines**

1. Code for what is **explicitly** written, not what is implied.  
2. Carefully consider the language being used–this will help decipher whether something is explicitly framed or just merely implied.  
3. Tally the exemplars (or, specific instances of framing) of each category as you read them. Do not read the entire article and then report on the number of exemplars.

**What exactly is leadership, in our case**?

The ability for a person or group of people to enlist the aid or support of like-minded individuals to accomplish a common task–in spheres of **business**, **government**, and **academia/education**.

**Frames to Code For**

1. Underrepresentation  
   1. Must explicitly state a group’s appearance in leadership at rates **LOWER** than expected.   
   2. Can include numbers but does not have to include numbers  
   3. Examples:   
      1. “Men of color are hired at much lower rates compared to white men, in the context of fulfilling CEO roles.”   
      2. “Of C-suite leaders today, 21% are women and just [1%](https://leanin.org/black-women-racism-discrimination-at-work?utm_campaign=blackwomenatwork&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=social#endnote34) are Black women.”  
   * Why this counts: Percentages are being used to suggest women are getting less than their fair share, as 21% is LIKELY less than the fact that 50% of society are women and more than 1% are Black women. The word “just” suggests the author is conveying that Black women are too low.  
2. Overrepresentation  
   1. Must explicitly state a group’s appearance in leadership at rates **HIGHER** than expected.   
   2. Can include numbers but does not have to include numbers  
   3. Examples:  
      1. “White and male employees remain overrepresented in positions that pay the highest salaries, offer the best benefits and provide a path to promotions in the Standard & Poor's 100.”   
      2. “Men comprise nearly more than half of all CEO positions in the textile industry (87%), considerably more than women.“  
3. Obstacles  
   1. Describes a systemic hindrance or barrier in pursuing leadership.  
   2. Examples can look something like:  
      1. “...regardless of a Black woman’s desire to advance in her career, there are seemingly insurmountable barriers ahead of her that make it harder to reach the top.”  
      2. “Cooke, along with several other diversity leaders and experts, breaks down how sexism, racism and a lack of leadership support impact Black women’s experiences at work.”  
   * Why this counts: Sexism, racism, and little support are the obstacles.  
     3. “There’s a very clear trend that women are having a harder time in the workplace than men; women of color are having a harder work experience than White women and Black women are having sort of the hardest experience overall.”  
   * Why this counts: They aren’t saying *why* women are having a harder time, but there is an **explicit** focus on there being a problem only women are experiencing.  
4. Successes  
   1. Describing an achievement or accomplishment in pursuing leadership.  
   2. Examples can look something like:  
      1. “This woman of color just became the first ever CEO in this company’s history.”  
      2. “Asian-American men are making great strides as local governmental leaders.

**Exemplar Examples**

Below are examples of exemplars (instances of framing) you might come across. Different font colors indicate different exemplars within a sentence, along with which frames the different exemplars would be tallied as. 

EXAMPLE 1

Whereas White women are up against a “glass ceiling,” Black women are up against a “concrete ceiling.”

* White women obstacle  
* Minority women obstacle

EXAMPLE 2 

\*Note: even though the frame (i.e., obstacle) is the same, there are four (4) tally marks to make for this small passage, because there are four separate instances of minority women framed as facing obstacles.

Black women report experiencing very intractable race-based stereotypes. They report their credibility and authority are called into question. They do not receive the type of institutional support they need.

* Minority women obstacle  
* Minority women obstacle  
* Minority women obstacle  
* Minority women obstacle

EXAMPLE 3 

\*Note: In this case, the juxtaposition of board seats across groups of women is an **explicit** framing of “White women overrepresentation” (two exemplars in this passage), along with three exemplars of “Minority women underrepresentation”.

Between 2016 and 2018, there were a total of 230 new board seats within Fortune 500 firms. Across these openings white women obtained 124, black women 32, asian women 17, and hispanic women only 4 seats, according to [Catalyst](https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-minorities-corporate-boards), a research organization. Some worry Goldman’s requirement is another way for white women to benefit, yet again, from diversity efforts.

* White women overrepresentation  
* Minority women underrepresented  
* Minority women underrepresented  
* Minority women underrepresented  
* White women overrepresentation
